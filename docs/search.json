    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nOur team has previous experience in understanding human behavior, including analyzing how users and authors interact with newsrooms to uncover content preferences. This experience demonstrated how measurable patterns can provide insight into audience behavior. Building on this foundation, the current project aims to explore listener behavior on Spotify, using music as a lens to understand audience preferences and trends. Spotify provides detailed audio features, such as danceability, energy, valence, and tempo, that capture the mood, structure, and behavioral qualities of songs. These features offer a measurable way to study how listening preferences and musical styles have evolved over time. In particular, the project seeks to answer questions such as whether modern songs are more energetic or danceable than older music, and how the emotional tone of popular tracks has changed. By comparing audio features across multiple decades, the study aims to uncover how cultural trends, technological advances, and audience behavior are reflected in the sound and feel of popular music.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nAfter importing our playlist data into R, we will check each variable for missing or incomplete information. Some tracks, especially older or region-restricted ones, may lack metadata such as release year or popularity, and a small number may be missing specific audio features if Spotify’s internal analysis is unavailable for that track. Additionally, removed or unavailable songs in playlists sometimes appear as placeholders, which can create NA values during extraction. We will examine all key audio-feature fields, including danceability, energy, valence, tempo, and liveness, to identify missing entries. Any tracks with major missing fields will likely be removed from the analysis to maintain data quality, since imputing musical attributes could introduce bias. This process will ensure the final dataset is complete, consistent, and suitable for the comparisons we plan to conduct.",
