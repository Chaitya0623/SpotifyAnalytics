# Data

## Description

The Spotify Web API provides access to detailed information about tracks, albums, artists, and playlists. This includes track-level metadata, audio features, and artist-level information, which are generated and maintained by Spotify. The data is returned in JSON format and can be imported into R for analysis.

## Missing value analysis

After importing our playlist data into R, we will check each variable for missing or incomplete information. Some tracks, especially older or region-restricted ones, may lack metadata such as release year or popularity, and a small number may be missing specific audio features if Spotify’s internal analysis is unavailable for that track. Additionally, removed or unavailable songs in playlists sometimes appear as placeholders, which can create NA values during extraction. We will examine all key audio-feature fields, including danceability, energy, valence, tempo, and liveness, to identify missing entries. Any tracks with major missing fields will likely be removed from the analysis to maintain data quality, since imputing musical attributes could introduce bias. This process will ensure the final dataset is complete, consistent, and suitable for the comparisons we plan to conduct.

## Notes / Limitations
- Popularity is a relative metric, not raw play counts.  
- Playlist data may be biased toward curator selections.  
- Some older tracks may have incomplete release-date information.  
- Genre labels are internally assigned by Spotify and may be inconsistent.  
- Audio features are algorithmically generated, and values may contain slight noise.
